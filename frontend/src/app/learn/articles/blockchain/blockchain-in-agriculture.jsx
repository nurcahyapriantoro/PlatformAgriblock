        <h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">Key Challenges in Agricultural Supply Chains</h2>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Before exploring blockchain solutions, it's important to understand the specific challenges facing 
          agricultural supply chains:
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">1. Limited Traceability</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Traditional agricultural supply chains often rely on paper-based records or fragmented digital systems that 
          don't communicate with each other. This makes it difficult to track products from farm to consumer. According to 
          a study by Feng et al. (2020), nearly 70% of consumers express concern about their inability to verify food origins 
          and handling conditions.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">2. Food Fraud and Counterfeiting</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          The global cost of food fraud is estimated at $30-40 billion annually (PwC, 2020). High-value agricultural 
          products such as organic foods, premium coffees, and specialty crops are particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting 
          and fraudulent labeling.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">3. Food Safety Concerns</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          The World Health Organization estimates that 600 million people fall ill from contaminated food each year. When 
          foodborne illness outbreaks occur, tracing the source of contamination can take days or even weeks using traditional 
          record-keeping methods, potentially endangering more consumers (WHO, 2020).
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">4. Lack of Farmer Empowerment</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Small-scale farmers often have limited visibility into the final value of their products and may not receive 
          fair compensation. A study by the FAO found that farmers typically receive only 4-28% of the final retail price 
          of their products (Tripoli & Schmidhuber, 2018).
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">5. Administrative Inefficiency</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Agricultural supply chains involve numerous stakeholders, each with their own record-keeping systems, leading 
          to duplication of effort, administrative costs, and opportunities for error.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">How Blockchain Addresses Agricultural Challenges</h2>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Blockchain technology offers unique capabilities that address these challenges by creating transparent, 
          immutable, and shared records across the entire supply chain. Let's examine how blockchain is being applied 
          to specific areas within agriculture:
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">1. Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Blockchain provides a shared, tamper-proof ledger that records every transaction and movement of agricultural 
          products from their origin to final consumption. This enables:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Complete product history with timestamp verification</li>
          <li>Real-time tracking of product location and status</li>
          <li>Verification of handling conditions throughout the supply chain</li>
          <li>Rapid traceback in case of food safety incidents</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="mb-4 mt-6">
          Research by Galvez et al. (2018) demonstrated that blockchain-based traceability can reduce the time required 
          to trace a food product's origin from days to seconds, potentially saving lives during contamination events.
        </p>
        
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-100 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">

            <Truck className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
            Case Study: IBM Food Trust
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-0">
            Walmart partnered with IBM to implement a blockchain-based traceability system for leafy greens that reduced 
            the time required to trace product origins from 7 days to 2.2 seconds. Following a pilot program, Walmart 
            now requires major suppliers of leafy greens to participate in the blockchain system, demonstrating the 
            technology's scalability and effectiveness (IBM, 2019).
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">2. Food Safety and Quality Assurance</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          By creating immutable records of testing, certification, and handling conditions, blockchain helps ensure 
          food safety throughout the supply chain:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Records of compliance with safety and quality standards</li>
          <li>Documentation of testing processes and results</li>
          <li>Temperature and handling condition monitoring via IoT integration</li>
          <li>Rapid identification of contamination sources</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="mb-4 mt-6">
          A study by Creydt and Fischer (2019) found that blockchain implementation in food safety management can 
          reduce the risk of foodborne illness by enabling rapid identification and removal of contaminated products, 
          as well as preventing the sale of expired or improperly handled items.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">3. Authentication of Product Claims</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Blockchain provides a solution to verify product claims and combat fraud:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Verification of organic, fair trade, and other certifications</li>
          <li>Authentication of product origin and variety (e.g., specialty coffee, premium rice)</li>
          <li>Proof of sustainable or ethical farming practices</li>
          <li>Prevention of counterfeit products entering the supply chain</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="mb-4 mt-6">
          Research by Kamble et al. (2020) demonstrated that blockchain can significantly reduce fraud in high-value 
          agricultural products by providing consumers with verifiable proof of authenticity and helping producers 
          protect their premium brands.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">4. Fair Trade and Farmer Empowerment</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Blockchain can help ensure farmers receive fair compensation and have greater market access:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Transparent pricing information throughout the supply chain</li>
          <li>Verifiable record of payments to farmers</li>
          <li>Direct connection between farmers and end consumers</li>
          <li>Reduced dependence on intermediaries</li>
          <li>Access to premium markets through verified sustainability practices</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="mb-4 mt-6">
          As Kamilaris et al. (2019) note in their review of blockchain applications in agriculture, "Blockchain enables 
          small-scale farmers to demonstrate compliance with quality standards and sustainable practices, potentially 
          allowing them to command premium prices and access new markets."
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">5. Supply Chain Efficiency and Reduced Waste</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Blockchain streamlines administrative processes and helps reduce food waste:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Automated documentation and verification processes</li>
          <li>Reduction in paperwork and manual record-keeping</li>
          <li>Improved inventory management and reduced spoilage</li>
          <li>More efficient logistics and transportation planning</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="mb-4 mt-6">
          A 2021 study by the World Economic Forum estimated that blockchain and related technologies could reduce 
          food loss and waste by up to 30% in global supply chains by improving inventory management, optimizing 
          transportation, and enabling better demand forecasting (WEF, 2021).
